Szabolcs Hlatky's personal portfolio website in Hungarian and English.
I'm looking for a JavaScript Engineer job as soon as possible.
Please look around on my Curriculum Vitae site and contact me if you are interested.

The site includes:

- Introduction
- Studies with my certificates
- Work experiences (more reference are coming)
- My technologies
- Languages and etc.
- Contacts and a form*.

*The form is more for design purpose... The form validation may not work because I didn't want to use any backend service.

As you can see the codes, I used HTML, SCSS and TypeScript to create it.

For compiling I used simply the terminal with these commands:

$ sass style.scss:style.css --embed-source-map --watch
$ tsc script --target es5 --inlineSourceMap --watch --allowJs --resolveJsonModule --esModuleInterop

I really liked the glassmorphism design trend and I used some ideas from the YouTube.

Of course this page will be updated continuously
